      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <div xmlns="">
      <p>
        <strong>
          #1 bestselling author John Green returns with his
      first new novel since
          <em>The Fault in Our Stars</em>
          !
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        Sixteen-year-old Aza never intended to pursue the
      mystery of fugitive billionaire Russell Pickett, but
      there’s a hundred-thousand-dollar reward at stake and
      her Best and Most Fearless Friend, Daisy, is eager to
      investigate. So together, they navigate the short distance
      and broad divides that separate them from Russell
      Pickett’s son, Davis.
        <br />
        <br />
        Aza is trying. She is trying to be a good daughter, a
      good friend, a good student, and maybe even a good detective,
      while also living within the ever-tightening spiral of her
      own thoughts.
        <br />
        <br />
        In his long-awaited return, John Green, the acclaimed,
      award-winning author of
        <em>Looking for Alaska</em>
        and
        <em>The Fault in Our Stars,</em>
        shares Aza’s story
      with shattering, unflinching clarity in this brilliant novel
      of love, resilience, and the power of lifelong
      friendship.

          CRITICAL ACCLAIM FOR
          <em>THE FAULT IN OUR STARS</em>
          :
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        “Damn near genius . . .
        <em>The Fault in Our Stars</em>
        is a love story, one of the
      most genuine and moving ones in recent American fiction, but
      it’s also an existential tragedy of tremendous
      intelligence and courage and sadness.” —
        <strong>
          Lev Grossman,
          <em>TIME</em>
          Magazine
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        “This is a book that breaks your heart—not
      by wearing it down, but by making it bigger until it
      bursts.” —
        <strong>
          <em>The Atlantic</em>
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        “Remarkable . . . A pitch-perfect, elegiac
      comedy.” ***—USA Today
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        “[Green’s] voice is so compulsively readable
      that it defies categorization. You will be thankful for the
      little infinity you spend inside this book.”
        <strong>—NPR.org</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        “John Green deftly mixes the profound and the
      quotidian in this tough, touching valentine to the human
      spirit.”
        <strong>
          <em>—The Washington Post</em>
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        “[Green] shows us true love—two teenagers
      helping and accepting each other through the most humiliating
      physical and emotional ordeals—and it is far more
      romantic than any sunset on the beach.” —
