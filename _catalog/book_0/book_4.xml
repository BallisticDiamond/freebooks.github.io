      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <div xmlns="">
      <p>
        <strong>A remarkable story of strange beauty and
        self-discovery from Printz Award winner Nick Lake.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Cassie is writing a letter to the boy whose heart she
      broke. She's trying to explain why. Why she pushed him away.
      Why her father got so angry when he saw them together. Why
      she disappears some nights. Why she won't let herself
      remember what happened that long-ago night on the boardwalk.
      Why she fell apart so completely.</p>
      <p>Desperate for his forgiveness, she's telling the whole
      story of the summer she nearly lost herself. She's hoping
      that love-love for your family, love for that person who
      makes your heart beat faster, and love for yourself-can save
      both of them after all.</p>

      <h3>Review</h3>
      <p>
        "Cassie’s charming, self-deprecating narrative and
      the insight into her mental health are engrossing and
      moving." ―
        <em>Booklist</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        "Perplexing and disorienting, full of the rich language
      and heady epiphanies readers have come to expect from the
      Printz-award winning author." ―starred review,
        <em>School Library Journal on THERE WILL BE LIES</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        "Impressively unpredictable--a motley mix of taut
      thriller, transportive fantasy, and poignant coming-of-age .
      . . Shelby narrates the surreal implosion of her life in an
      indignant, funny voice, à la Judy Blume." ―
        <em>Entertainment Weekly on THERE WILL BE LIES</em>
      </p>
      <p>

      power of story itself." ―
        <em>Kirkus Reviews on THERE WILL BE LIES</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        "Lake returns to the mix of reality and fantasy he used to
      great success in his Printz-winning
        <em>In Darkness</em>
        . . . Shelby is highly sympathetic."
      ―
        <em>Publishers Weekly on THERE WILL BE LIES</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        "A twisty drama suffused with elements of folklore."
