<strong>Summary</strong>
</p>
<div xmlns="">
      
<p>
        
<strong>In this spectacular father/son collaboration,
        Stephen King and Owen King tell the highest of high-stakes
        stories: what might happen if women disappeared from the
        world of men?</strong>
      
</p>
      
<p>In a future so real and near it might be now, something
      happens when women go to sleep: they become shrouded in a
      cocoon-like gauze. If they are awakened, if the gauze
      wrapping their bodies is disturbed or violated, the women
      become feral and spectacularly violent. And while they sleep
      they go to another place, a better place, where harmony
      prevails and conflict is rare.</p>
      
<p>One woman, the mysterious &ldquo;Eve Black,&rdquo; is
      immune to the blessing or curse of the sleeping disease. Is
      Eve a medical anomaly to be studied? Or is she a demon who
      must be slain? Abandoned, left to their increasingly primal
      urges, the men divide into warring factions, some wanting to
      kill Eve, some to save her. Others exploit the chaos to wreak
      their own vengeance on new enemies. All turn to violence in a
      suddenly all-male world.</p>
      
<p>Set in a small Appalachian town whose primary employer is
      a women&rsquo;s prison, 
      <em>Sleeping Beauties</em> is a wildly provocative,
      gloriously dramatic father-son collaboration that feels
      particularly urgent and relevant today.</p>
      
<p>**</p>
      
<h3>Review</h3>
      
<p>&ldquo;This delicious first collaboration between Stephen
      King and his son Owen is a horror-tinged realistic fantasy
      that imagines what could happen if most of the women of the
      world fall asleep, leaving men on their own. The
      authors&rsquo; writing is seamless and naturally flowing.
      Once the action begins, [SLEEPING BEAUTIES] barrels along
      like a freight train.&rdquo; (Publishers Weekly)</p>
      
<p>&ldquo;Another horror blockbuster, Mercedes and all, from
      maestro King and his heir apparent&hellip;In a kind of untold
      Greek tragedy meets Deliverance meets&mdash;well, bits of Mr.
      Mercedes and The Shawshank Redemption, perhaps&mdash;King and
      King, father and son, take their time putting all the pieces
      into play: brutish men, resourceful women who've had quite
      enough, alcohol, and always a subtle sociological subtext, in
      this case of rural poverty and dreams sure to be
      dashed&hellip;A blood-splattered pleasure.&rdquo; (Kirkus
      (starred review))</p>
      
<p>&ldquo;Following the renewed interest in Margaret
      Atwood&rsquo;s 
      <em>The Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale</em> and an increasing climate
      of wolf-whistle politics, this examination of gender
      stereotypes, systems of oppression, and pervasive misogyny
      within American culture feels especially timely&hellip;The
      large cast of characters allows for a multitude of narrative
      perspectives&mdash;from both the affected women and the men
      they&rsquo;ve left behind. Violent, subversive, and
      compulsively readable. The true horror of this
      father-son-penned novel derives more from its unflinchingly
      realistic depiction of hatred and violence against women than
      from the supernatural elements.&rdquo; (Library Journal)</p>
